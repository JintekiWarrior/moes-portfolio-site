        Having a growth mindset is the way I have always been. I am using that
      mind set to be as successful at software engineering as I can possibly
      be. With four full stack projects under my belt, and a handful
      of languages learned I am determined to help others with their web
      application needs.

        When I was in highschool my interest in programming began. I would make
    games using the python programming language and a library called pygame.
    When I graduated I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do. I thought
    coding would only be a hobby for me and went to college to become a
    mechanic.

        After working as a mechanic for a while at a large company I enjoyed it
    however it did not feel like what I wanted to do forever. My friend who
    worked there at a time suggested becoming a banker. It was a good and
    lucrative trade.

        I worked as a banker for two years picking up many new skills, such as
    sales, and time management. It was difficult and I enjoyed the
    challenge. It also did not seem like the perfect career for me. So I
    decided to really try coding.

        As of now I am satisfied. I have really enjoyed all aspects of computer
    programming so far and will certainly continue my journey as one. As of
    now I am beggining to feel confident in my skills as a web developer and
    am looking for employment as one.
