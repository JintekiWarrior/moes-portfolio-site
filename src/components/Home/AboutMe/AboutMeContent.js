        My interest in computers and tech came at an early age when I began to learn python and made
        some applications using it. I attended college for a while to pursue a computer science degree however,
        some other complications rose and I could never finish my degree. Instead I joined the workforce and did
        other things for a while with my proffessional life learning many skills, life lessons, and gaining a
        great amount of self discipline.

        As of recently I have begun my true journey into the world of software and will remain learning and
        growing in this skill as much as I can. As of now I believe I am pretty decent in Javascript, HTML, and css,
        as well as some frameworks such as react, and bootstrap. I can make api's using node, and python, as well
        as some data structures such as mongoDB, and postgreSQL. I hope to use these tools to craft a fine career
        in software development as well as anything else I intend to pick up.

        while bieng honest and respectful to those around me. I maintain such growth by reading,
        researching, and of course exchanging knowledge with other like minded indivduals.
